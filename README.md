## Companyâ€™s back ground

AltiQ hardware is a company which has grown vastly in the recent years, and opened business all over the globe. It is a company which sells, computer and computer accessories through three mediums/channel

- Retailers

Recently the company has faced a unforeseen loss by opening store in America based on the surveys, intuition and some excel analysis and also the companyâ€™s competitors has handful of analytics team to perform analysis and make data driven decision. So, the AltiQ hardware has no other option other than building their analytics team for data driven insights and decisions in the future to survive better in the industry. 

Project kick off session, where you should get clear of for what and why this project and all other questions you have with regards to the project

### Questions to ask before starting with dashboard

- What is the objective of building this PowerBi dashboard?
- In what terms the success of this project will be measured?
- What will be time dead-line of the project?
- do the stakeholders expecting pre-view before the actual release?
- What are all the hopes stakeholders have out of this project?
- what are all fears the stakeholder have in terms of building this dashboard?
- Who are all will be using this dashboard and for what purpose?
- what are all expectation the stakeholders have, by the completion of this project?
- What can go wrong while building this project?
- what are all the resources/ data needed to build this dashboard?
- is there any inputs from stakeholders in terms of design and views of the dashboard?

After the project kick off meetings, the data engineering team has given the data as per the request of data analytics team, letâ€™s explore them.

### Dataset **Understanding.**

Understanding what data is available will be more helpful while doing analysis. before jumping on to the analysis get good understanding of what are data available.

Dimension table : It will have the static data like details of customer and products

Fact table : It will have the data about the transactions  

- gdb041:
    - dim_customer

        - This table is used to forecast the customerâ€™s need in advance, which can help in
            - Higher customer satisfaction
            - Reduced cost in warehouses for storage purpose
        - The table is denormalized by data engineering team, as it is a data warehouse which is aimed to be used for analytical work.
        - All the date of the month will be replaced by the start date of the month
        - It will have all the column names and in the end it will have the forecast quantity need of the customer
    - fact_sales_monthly

    - Post_invoice_deductions
        - Post invoice deductions and other deductions details

## Importing data into PowerBi

- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
- Following Good practices of data modeling is must. Refer this page to get to know the good practices [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
- In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.
